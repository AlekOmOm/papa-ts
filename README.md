# papa-ts

This library exposes PAPA, your Personal Assistant powered by Private AI, which can be used in any browser environment and completely offline.
Under the hood, it uses [langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs) to implement the RAG-Pipeline and [Orama](https://github.com/askorama/orama) as a vectorstore.

# Usage

Currently, it is only used by our [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/your-papa/obsidian-Smart2Brain). We plan on making it easier to integrate so that anyone can have their own personal assistant in their application.
